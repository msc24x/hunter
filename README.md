## Overview

Users can sign up with Github for the free account and start creating competitions. Along with the competition meta data and scheduling information, you can add questions to your contest. Host can add as many questions they like. A question will consists of statement, sample test cases and final test cases. Each question can have positive and negative marking according to your requirement.

On the side of the participants, users who wish to just participate can get ready in the compete page, where all the competitions, which were made public by the hosts, would appear. Any one can get started with them when they are live. Users can submit the code, test them again samples and final submit and track their performance.

Users submit their solution code to the online judge built for Hunter, that detects the language, compiles it and test it against the test cases provided by the host user. All this is done by a homegrown execution engine called 'Showdown', which is in testing phase and will be open source soon. All the results would be public on a live scoreboard during the competition.
